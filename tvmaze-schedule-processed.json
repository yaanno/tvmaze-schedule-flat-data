TaxSlayer.com became the title sponsor in 2011 and the bowl took its current name in 2014 after a new contract. The bowl is operated by Gator Bowl Sports and will be played on January 2 starting in 2015. According to writer Anthony C. DiMarco, Charles Hilty, Sr. first conceived of the event. Hilty, together with Ray McCarthy, Maurice Cherry, and W. C. Ivey, put up $10,000 to underwrite the first game, which was held at Jacksonville's football stadium, Fairfield Stadium, on January 1, 1946. The first two years of the event did not sell out the small capacity stadium, drawing only 7,362 to the 1946 match when the Wake Forest Demon Deacons defeated the South Carolina Gamecocks, 26–14. The stadium was expanded in 1948 and renamed the Gator Bowl Stadium in honor of the event. However, it was not until the 1949 match-up between the Clemson Tigersand the Missouri Tigers that the future of the Gator Bowl was assured. The 1948 attendance of 16,666 for a 20–20 tie between Maryland and Georgia, was nearly doubled with 32,939 watching Clemson squeak by Missouri, 24–23, on a late field goal by Jack Miller.

The Sun Bowl, along with the Sugar Bowl and the Orange Bowl, are the second-oldest bowl games in the country, behind the Rose Bowl (first played 1902, played annually since 1916). In most of its early history, the game pitted the champion of the Border Conference against an at-large opponent. Games are now played at Sun Bowl Stadium on the campus of the University of Texas at El Paso. The first three were played at El Paso High School stadium (1935–1937), then switched to Kidd Field until the present stadium was ready in 1963. For its first 24 years of existence, the game was played on January 1 (New Year's Day) or January 2; since then, with the exception of a January 2 game in 1977, the game has been played in December, with the 25 of the last 27 games played on or near December 31.</p><p>The game's current full title is the \"Hyundai Sun Bowl\", which became the name after Hyundai Motor Company's American subsidiary bought naming rights to the bowl from Helen of Troy Limited on June 24, 2010. Hyundai becomes the fourth title sponsor of the Sun Bowl, after Helen of Troy (through its Vitalis and Brut brands),Norwest Corporation/Wells Fargo, and John Hancock Insurance; the bowl was known as the John Hancock Bowl for the last five years of the firm's contract with the bowl. Hyundai signed a four-year contract with the Sun Bowl committee, which runs through the 2013 game. Since 2014, the Sun Bowl Football Selection Committee has shared the third through sixth selections from the ACC with the Belk Bowl, the Pinstripe Bowl and either theTaxslayer Bowl or the Music City Bowl. The Orange Bowl has the conference champion or the first selection, followed by the Russell Athletic Bowl.</p><p>On the Pac-12 side, the Sun Bowl will have the fourth selection following the newly formed College Football Playoff. The 1992 game was the final head-coaching appearance of College Football Hall of Famer (and future AFCA Executive Director) Grant Teaff of Baylor. Teaff's Bears won over Arizona. The 1940 Sun Bowl set the record for fewest points scored, when the Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe Bulldogs played the Catholic University Cardinals to a 0–0 tie. It is the only scoreless tie in Sun Bowl History.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2674118,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2674118/pa-sparet-34x09-avsnitt-9","name":"Avsnitt 9","season":34,"number":9,"airdate":"2023-12-29","airstamp":"2023-12-29T19:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":12259,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/12259/pa-sparet","name":"På Spåret","language":"Swedish","genres":[],"premiered":"1987-09-05","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"SVT Play","id":190,"url":"https://www.svtplay.se/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/41/103474.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/41/103474.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Two teams of Swedish celebrities compete.

It first aired in 1987 with Tim Brando as host and Lee Corso and Beano Cook as commentators, giving an overview of college football games, but the show underwent a radical transformation beginning in 1993, and began incorporating live broadcasts. The official name of the show is <i>College GameDay built by The Home Depot</i>. There is a separate radio broadcast, <i>ESPN Radio College GameDay</i>, on ESPN Radio. Today, the only original cast member remaining is Lee Corso. Rece Davis serves as host and Kirk Herbstreit is Corso's counterpart. Starting in 2008, Desmond Howardhas been added to the cast in the show's introduction. Craig James served as an analyst from 1990 to 1995. Erin Andrews joined the <i>GameDay</i> crew as a co-host and contributor in 2010, replaced in 2012 by Samantha Ponder. On September 5, 2015, Rece Davis (also host of the college basketball version of <i>GameDay</i>), replaced Chris Fowler as host of the college football version, which itself started its 29th season on that day.</p><p>The show is known for its prediction segment that appears on each broadcast. Typically there are three predictors: Corso, Herbstreit, and an invited guest, usually a celebrity, prominent athlete, or radio personality associated with the host university or school for that week. The end of the show always concludes with a catch phrase and prediction from Corso, who subsequently dons the mascot's headgear of the school he predicts to win the game, usually to the ire or excitement of local fans. Beginning with the 2013 season, <i>GameDay</i> airs for three hours on ESPN. Previously, beginning in 2010, the first hour of the show was broadcast on ESPNU at 9am ET, with the 2 remaining hours of the show on ESPN from 10am-noon ET.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2694172,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2694172/langkha-bai-bua-1x20-episode-20","name":"Episode 20","season":1,"number":20,"airdate":"2023-12-30","airstamp":"2023-12-30T14:45:00+00:00","show":{"id":72153,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/72153/langkha-bai-bua","name":"Langkha Bai Bua","language":"Thai","genres":["Drama","Romance"],"premiered":"2023-10-22","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"Amarin TV","id":1400},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/483/1207656.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/483/1207656.jpg"},"summary":null,"country":{"name":"Thailand","code":"TH"}}},{"id":2686436,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2686436/dead-friend-forever-1x02-episode-2","name":"Episode 2","season":1,"number":2,"airdate":"2023-12-30","airstamp":"2023-12-30T15:30:00+00:00","show":{"id":72385,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/72385/dead-friend-forever","name":"Dead Friend Forever","language":"Thai","genres":["Romance","Thriller","Mystery"],"premiered":"2023-12-23","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"One31","id":1262},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/484/1210725.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/484/1210725.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>Dead Friend Forever</b> follows friends who travel together to a vacation house in the middle of the woods as their farewell trip for a friend who will be leaving to study aboard.

The ACC also took part in the 2005 game, when Virginia appeared because the SEC did not have enough bowl-eligible teams. Beginning in 2014, the Music City Bowl shares its tie in with the TaxSlayer Bowl; the Music City Bowl receives second choice of either an ACC or Big Ten team.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2705014,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2705014/the-masked-singer-5x01-episode-1","name":"Episode 1","season":5,"number":1,"airdate":"2023-12-30","airstamp":"2023-12-30T19:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":43691,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/43691/the-masked-singer","name":"The Masked Singer","language":"English","genres":["Music"],"premiered":"2020-01-04","rating":4.9,"channel":{"name":"ITV1","id":35,"url":"https://www.itv.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/444/1111417.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/444/1111417.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Part guessing game and part singing show, <b>The Masked Singer</b> sees 12 famous faces compete to pull off the best performance, with their identity elaborately and imaginatively concealed, thanks to an expert team of talented costume designers.

The Orange Bowl, along with the Sugar Bowl and the Sun Bowl, are the second-oldest bowl games in the country, behind the Rose Bowl (first played 1902, played annually since 1916).

However, beginning with the 2006 season, the BCS National Championship Game became a stand-alone event, hosted by the local bowl organization about one week following the New Year's Day bowl games (including the Orange Bowl). Under that format the Orange Bowl Committee hosted two separate games in both 2009 (the 2009 Orange Bowl on January 1 and the 2009 BCS National Championship Game on January 8) and in 2013 (the 2013 Orange Bowl on January 1 and the 2013 BCS National Championship Game on January 7), all at Sun Life Stadium. The BCS ended after the 2013 season, being replaced by the current College Football Playoff.</p><p>Since 2007, the Orange Bowl has been host to the Atlantic Coast Conference champion unless they are involved in the national championship game (whereas the #2 ACC team would take their place) and has used the brand <i>Home of the ACC Champion</i>.

As of 2014, the program has won four Emmy Awards. <i>Fox NFL Sunday</i> debuted on September 4, 1994, when Fox inaugurated its NFL game broadcasts through the network's recently acquired broadcast rights to the National Football Conference; it was originally hosted by James Brown, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson (both Brown and Bradshaw had joined the network from CBS to help helm Fox's NFL coverage). The program was notable in being the first hour-long NFL pregame show on a broadcast television network; network pregame programs that existed beforehand, such as CBS' <i>The NFL Today</i> or NBC's <i>NFL Live!</i>, aired as 30-minute broadcasts. Fox's show also adopted a looser, more irreverent approach than its predecessors in order to also appeal to the network's younger-skewing audiences. During Johnson's initial season on <i>Fox NFL Sunday</i>, he would often join the show from his home in Florida. There was much speculation that Jimmy Johnson would return to coaching during the first year of the program's run. Prior to the end of the year, Johnson made an \"announcement,\" saying he was happy with his new career in broadcasting. But in 1996, he left the program to become head coach of the Miami Dolphins; Ronnie Lott was brought in to succeed him, and stayed with the program for two seasons.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2719432,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2719432/the-nfl-today-2023-12-31-week-17","name":"Week 17","season":2023,"number":19,"airdate":"2023-12-31","airstamp":"2023-12-31T17:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":32242,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/32242/the-nfl-today","name":"The NFL Today","language":"English","genres":["Sports"],"premiered":"2017-09-10","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"CBS","id":2,"url":"https://www.cbs.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/406/1016521.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/406/1016521.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>The NFL Today</b> is an American sports-talk television program on CBS that serves as the pre-game show for the network's National Football League (NFL) game telecasts under the <i>NFL on CBS</i> brand.

From socialites to secretaries, female killers share one thing in common: at some point, they all snapped. <b>Snapped </b>is produced in conjunction with Jupiter Entertainment, the creators of <i>City Confidential</i> and <i>Dominick Dunne's Power</i>, <i>Privilege &amp; Justice</i>, and narrated by veteran news reporter Sharon Martin. Each episode of <i>Snapped</i> chronicles the life of a woman who has been charged with murder. These shocking but true stories turn common assumptions about crime and criminals upside down, and prove that even the most unlikely suspects can be capable of murder.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2702678,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2702678/abc-world-news-tonight-with-david-muir-2023-12-31-episode-359","name":"Episode 359","season":2023,"number":359,"airdate":"2023-12-31","airstamp":"2023-12-31T23:30:00+00:00","show":{"id":9659,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/9659/abc-world-news-tonight-with-david-muir","name":"ABC World News Tonight with David Muir","language":"English","genres":[],"premiered":"2014-09-01","rating":6.8,"channel":{"name":"ABC","id":3,"url":"https://abc.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/405/1014833.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/405/1014833.jpg"},"summary":"<p>With unparalleled resources, <b>World News Tonight with David Muir</b> provides the latest information and analysis of major events from around the country and the world.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2717286,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2717286/hogmanay-live-2023-12-31-2023","name":"2023","season":2023,"number":1,"airdate":"2023-12-31","airstamp":"2023-12-31T23:30:00+00:00","show":{"id":34173,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/34173/hogmanay-live","name":"Hogmanay Live","language":"English","genres":[],"premiered":"2007-12-31","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"BBC One Scotland","id":1042},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/289/724998.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/289/724998.jpg"},"summary":"<p>BBC Scotland first-foots the nation and brings in the new year with a bang.</p>","country":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}},{"id":2717287,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2717287/joolss-annual-hootenanny-2023-12-31-202324","name":"2023/24","season":2023,"number":1,"airdate":"2023-12-31","airstamp":"2023-12-31T23:30:00+00:00","show":{"id":9997,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/9997/joolss-annual-hootenanny","name":"Jools's Annual Hootenanny","language":"English","genres":["Music"],"premiered":"1993-12-31","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"BBC Two","id":37,"url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/34/85636.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/34/85636.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Jools Holland and his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra present a evening of music and chat, welcoming in the next new year.</p>","country":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}},{"id":2717291,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2717291/rick-astley-rocks-new-years-eve-1x01-part-1","name":"Part 1","season":1,"number":1,"airdate":"2023-12-31","airstamp":"2023-12-31T23:30:00+00:00","show":{"id":73513,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/73513/rick-astley-rocks-new-years-eve","name":"Rick Astley Rocks New Year's Eve","language":"English","genres":["Music"],"premiered":"2023-12-31","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"BBC One","id":12,"url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcone"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/494/1235539.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/494/1235539.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Pop legend Rick Astley is joined by some special guests to put on a spectacular New Year's Eve party, performing a host of his global hits and party tunes.</p>","country":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}},{"id":2722124,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2722124/nbc-nightly-news-2023-12-31-dec-31","name":"Dec 31","season":2023,"number":348,"airdate":"2023-12-31","airstamp":"2023-12-31T23:30:00+00:00","show":{"id":9539,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/9539/nbc-nightly-news","name":"NBC Nightly News","language":"English","genres":[],"premiered":"1970-08-03","rating":6.1,"channel":{"name":"NBC","id":1,"url":"https://www.nbc.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/357/894983.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/357/894983.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>NBC Nightly News</b> (titled as <i>NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt</i> for its weeknight broadcasts since June 22, 2015) is the flagship daily evening television news program for NBC News, the news division of the NBC television network in the United States.

It first aired in 1987 with Tim Brando as host and Lee Corso and Beano Cook as commentators, giving an overview of college football games, but the show underwent a radical transformation beginning in 1993, and began incorporating live broadcasts. The official name of the show is <i>College GameDay built by The Home Depot</i>. There is a separate radio broadcast, <i>ESPN Radio College GameDay</i>, on ESPN Radio. Today, the only original cast member remaining is Lee Corso. Rece Davis serves as host and Kirk Herbstreit is Corso's counterpart. Starting in 2008, Desmond Howardhas been added to the cast in the show's introduction. Craig James served as an analyst from 1990 to 1995. Erin Andrews joined the <i>GameDay</i> crew as a co-host and contributor in 2010, replaced in 2012 by Samantha Ponder. On September 5, 2015, Rece Davis (also host of the college basketball version of <i>GameDay</i>), replaced Chris Fowler as host of the college football version, which itself started its 29th season on that day.</p><p>The show is known for its prediction segment that appears on each broadcast. Typically there are three predictors: Corso, Herbstreit, and an invited guest, usually a celebrity, prominent athlete, or radio personality associated with the host university or school for that week. The end of the show always concludes with a catch phrase and prediction from Corso, who subsequently dons the mascot's headgear of the school he predicts to win the game, usually to the ire or excitement of local fans. Beginning with the 2013 season, <i>GameDay</i> airs for three hours on ESPN. Previously, beginning in 2010, the first hour of the show was broadcast on ESPNU at 9am ET, with the 2 remaining hours of the show on ESPN from 10am-noon ET.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2705008,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2705008/riddiculous-2x01-episode-1","name":"Episode 1","season":2,"number":1,"airdate":"2024-01-01","airstamp":"2024-01-01T15:45:00+00:00","show":{"id":64681,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/64681/riddiculous","name":"Riddiculous","language":"English","genres":[],"premiered":"2022-10-24","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"ITV1","id":35,"url":"https://www.itv.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/490/1227364.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/490/1227364.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Quiz hosted by Ranvir Singh in which contestants take on Riddlemaster Henry Lewis as they attempt to answer general knowledge questions and confusing conundrums, with only one team making it through to the high-stakes final with a chance to win a cash prize.</p>","country":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB"}}},{"id":2682969,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2682969/rose-parade-2024-01-01-135th-rose-parade","name":"135th Rose Parade","season":2024,"number":1,"airdate":"2024-01-01","airstamp":"2024-01-01T16:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":24160,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/24160/rose-parade","name":"Rose Parade","language":"English","genres":[],"premiered":"2017-01-02","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"NBC","id":1,"url":"https://www.nbc.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/385/964584.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/385/964584.jpg"},"summary":"<p>The <b>Rose Parade</b>, also known as the <i>Tournament of Roses Parade</i> and the <i>Rose Parade</i> presented by Honda, is part of \"America's New Year Celebration\" held in Pasadena, California each year on New Year's Day (or on Monday, January 2 if New Year's Day falls on a Sunday).

The event was originally called the Hall of Fame Bowl from 1986 to 1994 until being renamed in 1995 for its new title sponsor, Outback Steakhouse. It is organized by the Tampa Bay Bowl Association under Jim McVay, who has been the president/CEO since 1988. The Outback Bowl is not Tampa's first bowl game, as the Cigar Bowl was played at old Phillips Field near downtown from 1947–1954. However, the earlier event matched small college teams, so the Outback Bowl was the first major bowl game to be played in the area. (A notable participant in the 1950 Cigar Bowl was Florida State, but the FSU football program had just begun at the time and they were not yet considered a major college team.)</p><p>The Hall of Fame Classic was held at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama from 1977–1985. In the spring of 1986, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame decided to discontinue their association with the bowl and realign with a new bowl game to be played in Tampa Stadium which would inherit the Hall of Fame Bowl name. The bowl did not have agreements to bring in teams from particular conferences in its early years but often matched a school from either the Southeastern Conference or the Atlantic Coast Conference against a team from another region. In 1999, the Outback Bowl was moved from Tampa Stadium into newly built Raymond James Stadium next door.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2625941,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2625941/raw-talk-8x01-raw-talk-196","name":"Raw Talk 196","season":8,"number":1,"airdate":"2024-01-01","airstamp":"2024-01-01T17:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":22473,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/22473/raw-talk","name":"RAW Talk","language":"English","genres":["Sports"],"premiered":"2016-10-30","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"WWE Network","id":15,"url":null},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/409/1024249.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/409/1024249.jpg"},"summary":"<p>On <b>RAW Talk</b>, Renee Young catches up with your favorite WWE RAW Superstars after each episode of \"RAW\" airs on the USA Network to hear their thoughts on all of that evening's action.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2670269,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2670269/kudus-fatihi-selahaddin-eyyubi-1x07-7-bolum","name":"7.

It was previously known as the Tangerine Bowl (1947–1982), the Florida Citrus Bowl (1983–2002), and the Capital One Bowl(2003–2014). The bowl is operated by Florida Citrus Sports, a non-profit group that also organizes the Russell Athletic Bowl and Florida Classic. Since becoming one of the premier bowls, the Citrus Bowl is typically played at 1 p.m. EST on January 1, New Year's Day, immediately before the Rose Bowl, both of which have been televised on ESPN since 2011. (In years when New Year's Day falls on a Sunday, the game is played on Monday, January 2 to avoid conflicting with the National Football League schedule.) In 2004, the Capital One Bowl bid to become the fifth BCS game, but was not chosen, primarily due to the stadium's aging condition. On July 26, 2007, the Orange County Commissioners voted 5–2 in favor of spending $1.1 billion to build a new arena for the Orlando Magic, a performing arts center, and to upgrade the Citrus Bowl.</p><p>Currently, the bowl has tie-ins with the SEC and the Big Ten, holding the first selection after the CFP selection process for both conferences.

After the 2014 formation of the College Football Playoff, the Citrus Bowl has a chance to occasionally host an ACC team, replacing the Big Ten representative. This will happen the years in which the Orange Bowl is not a semi-final game and selects a Big Ten team to match against their ACC team. Capital One ceased its sponsorship of the game following the 2014 game, and moved its sponsorship to the Orange Bowl.

When New Year's Day falls on a Sunday, the game is played on Monday, January 2 (14 times now). The Rose Bowl is nicknamed \"The Granddaddy of Them All\" because it is the oldest bowl game. It was first played in 1902, and has been played annually since 1916. Since 1945, it has been the highest attended college football bowl game. It is a part of the Tournament of Roses \"America's New Year Celebration\", which also includes the historic Tournament of Roses Parade. Beginning with the 2015 game, the official name for sponsorship is the \"Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual\". Vizio was the previous sponsor, since 2012; prior sponsors included AT&amp;T, Sony, and Citi. In 2015, the game will also be officially known as the \"College Football Playoff semifinal at the Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual\".</p><p>The Rose Bowl Game has traditionally hosted the conference champions from the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences (or their predecessors), but due to its past and present membership in several consortiums that seek to determine a national champion in Division I FBS, in 2002, the Rose Bowl began to infrequently deviate from its traditional match-up in order to facilitate championship games. In 2002 and 2006 (2001 and 2005 football seasons), under the Bowl Championship Series system, the Rose Bowl was designated as its championship game, and hosted the top two teams determined by the BCS system. Beginning in 2015, the Rose Bowl is part of theCollege Football Playoff system, and will host one of its semi-final games every three years. During non-Playoff years, the Rose Bowl will revert to a Pac-12/Big Ten matchup.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2681793,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2681793/the-five-2024-01-01-episode-261","name":"Episode 261","season":2023,"number":261,"airdate":"2024-01-01","airstamp":"2024-01-01T22:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":9068,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/9068/the-five","name":"The Five","language":"English","genres":[],"premiered":"2011-07-11","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"Fox News Channel","id":185,"url":"https://www.foxnews.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/473/1182683.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/473/1182683.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>The Five</b> is an American news and talk show on Fox News Channel featuring a rotating panel who discuss current stories, political issues, and pop culture.

The Sugar Bowl has been played annually since January 1, 1935, and celebrated its 75th anniversary on January 2, 2009. The Sugar Bowl, along with the Orange Bowl and Sun Bowl, are the second-oldest bowl games in the country, behind the Rose Bowl. The Sugar Bowl is also a member of the College Football Playoff. Presently, its official title is the Allstate Sugar Bowl after its current sponsor. The Sugar Bowl has had a longstanding —albeit not exclusive— relationship with the Southeastern Conference (which once had a member based in New Orleans,Tulane University; another Louisiana school, Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, is still in the SEC today). From 1950 to 1995, only once did the Sugar Bowl <i>not</i>feature an SEC team. That relationship has been altered over the past twenty years due to conference realignments and the emergence of a series of coalitions and alliances intending to produce an undisputed national champion in college football, but the ties between the Sugar Bowl and the SEC have persisted and have recently been strengthened.</p><p>Starting in January 2015, the Sugar Bowl game will be in a three-year rotation with the Rose, Orange, Cotton, Peach, and Fiesta bowls where they'll host a semifinal game the first year and feature the SEC and Big 12 conference champions the next two, an arrangement nearly identical with the relationship between the Rose Bowl and the champions of the Big Ten and Pac-12. As a member of the Bowl Championship Series, the Sugar Bowl hosted the BCS National Championship Game twice (2000 and 2004). However, from the 2006 season to the 2013 season, the BCS National Championship Game had been a stand-alone event, following one week after the New Year's Day bowl games. This means that, under the now-defunct BCS format, no traditional bowl game hosted the BCS National Championship Game, but that game <i>was</i> played at the <i>venue</i> of one of those traditional major bowls, rotating amongst the four sites, including the Superdome. The payout for the 2006 game was $14–17 million per participating team. According to <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, the 2007 salary for Sugar Bowl CEO Paul Hoolahan was $607,500.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2722038,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2722038/dig-more-japan-2024-01-02-greet-the-new-year","name":"Greet the New Year","season":2024,"number":1,"airdate":"2024-01-02","airstamp":"2024-01-02T01:45:00+00:00","show":{"id":56328,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/56328/dig-more-japan","name":"Dig More Japan","language":"English","genres":[],"premiered":"2020-11-03","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"NHK World","id":1096},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/439/1098281.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/439/1098281.jpg"},"summary":"<p>NHK WORLD-JAPAN broadcasts a variety of programs with 60 titles.

In order to pursue his dream to the best of his elementary school abilities, Tsubasa moves with his mother to Nankatsu city, which is well-known for its excellent elementary school soccer teams. But although he was easily the best in his old town, Nankatsu has a lot more competition, and he will need all of his skill and talent in order to stand out from this new crowd. He encounters not only rivals, but also new friends like the pretty girl Sanae Nakazawa and the talented goalkeeper, Genzo Wakabayashi, who shares the same passion as Tsubasa, and will prove to be a treasured friend in helping him push towards his dreams.

The Avenue of Heaven and Earth is like luck, where the able live. The road to the great road is the road to struggle for the road, which has caused the struggle of all races and souls. An era can only support a few people to gain the Tao. Those who have attained the Tao think that standing on the top of the world, they can be free in the future. But I found that even Dao. It's also hard to escape bad luck. There is a ruler above them, harvesting one era after another, and the cultivators of the world want to maintain their ambitions. Ten thousand races and all spirits are just nourished by these rulers. These masters harvest the Taoists, harvest the spirituality of each world, and destroy one by one. The Taoists in the past were unwilling to be reaped and resisted constantly, but failed every time. Until… the protagonist Ye Yu appeared, he peeled away one time and one secret. As he unfolded an epic picture scroll, in this magnificent world, he continued to grow, experience love and friendship, cleanse the dusted Taoist heart, and finally confront the master who harvests all races.</p>","country":{}}},{"id":2704541,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2704541/cravity-park-8x06-ep92","name":"EP.92","season":8,"number":6,"airdate":"2024-01-08","airstamp":"2024-01-08T12:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":63310,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/63310/cravity-park","name":"CRAVITY PARK","language":"Korean","genres":[],"premiered":"2020-06-01","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"YouTube","id":21,"url":"https://www.youtube.com"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/417/1044018.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/417/1044018.jpg"},"summary":"<p>CRAVITY members producing their own variety show through their own concepts every week.

It first aired in 1987 with Tim Brando as host and Lee Corso and Beano Cook as commentators, giving an overview of college football games, but the show underwent a radical transformation beginning in 1993, and began incorporating live broadcasts. The official name of the show is <i>College GameDay built by The Home Depot</i>. There is a separate radio broadcast, <i>ESPN Radio College GameDay</i>, on ESPN Radio. Today, the only original cast member remaining is Lee Corso. Rece Davis serves as host and Kirk Herbstreit is Corso's counterpart. Starting in 2008, Desmond Howardhas been added to the cast in the show's introduction. Craig James served as an analyst from 1990 to 1995. Erin Andrews joined the <i>GameDay</i> crew as a co-host and contributor in 2010, replaced in 2012 by Samantha Ponder. On September 5, 2015, Rece Davis (also host of the college basketball version of <i>GameDay</i>), replaced Chris Fowler as host of the college football version, which itself started its 29th season on that day.</p><p>The show is known for its prediction segment that appears on each broadcast. Typically there are three predictors: Corso, Herbstreit, and an invited guest, usually a celebrity, prominent athlete, or radio personality associated with the host university or school for that week. The end of the show always concludes with a catch phrase and prediction from Corso, who subsequently dons the mascot's headgear of the school he predicts to win the game, usually to the ire or excitement of local fans. Beginning with the 2013 season, <i>GameDay</i> airs for three hours on ESPN. Previously, beginning in 2010, the first hour of the show was broadcast on ESPNU at 9am ET, with the 2 remaining hours of the show on ESPN from 10am-noon ET.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2707353,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2707353/synduality-2x01-episode-1","name":"Episode 1","season":2,"number":1,"airdate":"2024-01-08","airstamp":"2024-01-08T15:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":66715,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/66715/synduality","name":"Synduality","language":"Japanese","genres":["Action","Anime","Science-Fiction"],"premiered":"2023-07-10","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"TV Tokyo","id":76},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/444/1111273.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/444/1111273.jpg"},"summary":"<p>The year is 2222.

The Coquihalla and nearby highways through BC's Cascade Mountains have some of the most difficult and fast changing road conditions anywhere. When it's snowing hard up top on the summit of ‘The Coq', 1200 metres below its pounding rain in The Fraser Valley. Add to that, Canada's busiest trucking route to the West Coast, Highway 1 (Trans Canada Hwy), and you have the ‘Bermuda Triangle' of trucking. Police and highway maintenance crews depend on Highway Thru Hell's heavy rescue operators to respond at a moment's notice in the worst conditions. In between the winter storms, the teams ‘off road' skills are put to the test. The rugged terrain near Hope, British Columbia dishes out some of the most unique and challenging recovery jobs over steep cliffs, down deep ravines and even in bodies of water. Highway Thru Hell is ultimately a series about man versus Mother Nature and the toughest men in the towing business being pushed to their breaking point. The stakes are high - lives, the economy and thousands of jobs depend on the highways staying open, and the last line of defense is Heavy Rescue.</p>","country":{"name":"Canada","code":"CA"}}},{"id":1790093,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/1790093/ncaa-college-football-national-championship-2024-01-08-2024-ncaa-college-football-national-championship-game","name":"2024 NCAA College Football National Championship Game","season":2024,"number":1,"airdate":"2024-01-08","airstamp":"2024-01-09T01:45:00+00:00","show":{"id":10179,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/10179/ncaa-college-football-national-championship","name":"NCAA College Football National Championship","language":"English","genres":[],"premiered":"2015-01-12","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"ESPN","id":39},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/236/590675.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/236/590675.jpg"},"summary":"<p>The <b>NCAA College Football National Championship </b>is a bowl game that determines the National Champion of NCAA Division I FBScollege football first played at the end of the 2014 – 2015 College Football season.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2723946,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2723946/dig-more-japan-2024-01-09-a-visit-to-shimane","name":"A Visit to Shimane","season":2024,"number":2,"airdate":"2024-01-09","airstamp":"2024-01-09T01:45:00+00:00","show":{"id":56328,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/56328/dig-more-japan","name":"Dig More Japan","language":"English","genres":[],"premiered":"2020-11-03","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"NHK World","id":1096},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/439/1098281.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/439/1098281.jpg"},"summary":"<p>NHK WORLD-JAPAN broadcasts a variety of programs with 60 titles.

They have seconds to plan and 30 minutes to cook an amazing course with the basket of mystery ingredients given to them moments before the clock starts ticking! And the pressure doesn't stop there. Once they've completed their dish, they've got to survive the Chopping Block where our three judges are waiting to be wowed and not shy about voicing their culinary criticisms! Our host, Ted Allen, leads this high-energy, high-pressure show that will have viewers rooting for a winner and cheering for the losers. <i>Chopped</i> is a game of passion, expertise and skill — and in the end, only one chef will survive the Chopping Block. Who will make the cut? The answer is on <i>Chopped!</i></p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2691500,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2691500/la-brea-3x04-fire-storm","name":"Fire Storm","season":3,"number":4,"airdate":"2024-01-30","airstamp":"2024-01-31T02:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":45856,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/45856/la-brea","name":"La Brea","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Fantasy","Science-Fiction"],"premiered":"2021-09-28","rating":6.4,"channel":{"name":"NBC","id":1,"url":"https://www.nbc.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/493/1233719.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/493/1233719.jpg"},"summary":"<p>When a massive sinkhole mysteriously opens in Los Angeles, it tears a family in half, separating mother and son from father and daughter.

The Super Bowl normally uses Roman numerals to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held. For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season. The single exception to this rule is Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015 regular season.</p><p>The game was created as part of a merger agreement between the NFL and its then-rival league, the American Football League (AFL). It was agreed that the two leagues' champion teams would play in the AFL–NFL World Championship Game until the merger was to officially begin in 1970. After the merger, each league was redesignated as a \"conference\", and the game has since been played between the conference champions to determine the NFL's league champion. Currently, theNational Football Conference (NFC) leads the league with 26 wins to 23 wins for the American Football Conference (AFC). The Pittsburgh Steelers hold the record for Super Bowl victories with six.</p><p>The day on which the Super Bowl is played, now considered by some an unofficial American national holiday, is called \"Super Bowl Sunday\". It is the second-largest day for U.S. food consumption, after Thanksgiving Day.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth.

Each conference team consists of 12 players, making it 24 in total. It is the featured event of NBA All-Star Weekend. NBA All-Star Weekend is a three-day event which goes from Friday to Sunday. The All-Star game was first staged at the Boston Garden on March 2, 1951. The starting line-up for each squad is selected by a fan ballot, while the reserves are chosen by a vote among the head coaches from each squad's respective conference. Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players. If a selected player is injured and cannot participate, the NBA commissioner selects a replacement.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there's Sheldon's beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric, and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy allows us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward, and hopeful journey toward the man he will become.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2699566,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2699566/next-level-chef-3x05-tba","name":"TBA","season":3,"number":5,"airdate":"2024-02-22","airstamp":"2024-02-23T01:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":55426,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/55426/next-level-chef","name":"Next Level Chef","language":"English","genres":["Food"],"premiered":"2022-01-02","rating":6.6,"channel":{"name":"FOX","id":4,"url":"https://www.fox.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/437/1094161.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/437/1094161.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Chef Gordon Ramsay scours the country for the very best line cooks, home chefs, social media stars, food truck owners and everything in between, all competing against one another with the goal of finding the food world's newest superstar.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there's Sheldon's beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric, and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there's Sheldon's beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric, and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy allows us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward, and hopeful journey toward the man he will become.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2699568,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2699568/next-level-chef-3x07-tba","name":"TBA","season":3,"number":7,"airdate":"2024-03-07","airstamp":"2024-03-08T01:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":55426,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/55426/next-level-chef","name":"Next Level Chef","language":"English","genres":["Food"],"premiered":"2022-01-02","rating":6.6,"channel":{"name":"FOX","id":4,"url":"https://www.fox.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/437/1094161.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/437/1094161.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Chef Gordon Ramsay scours the country for the very best line cooks, home chefs, social media stars, food truck owners and everything in between, all competing against one another with the goal of finding the food world's newest superstar.

young Sheldon Cooper, it isn't easy growing up in East Texas. Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there's Sheldon's beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric, and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy allows us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward, and hopeful journey toward the man he will become.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2689298,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2689298/9-1-1-7x01-tba","name":"TBA","season":7,"number":1,"airdate":"2024-03-14","airstamp":"2024-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":28152,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/28152/9-1-1","name":"9-1-1","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Action","Crime"],"premiered":"2018-01-03","rating":7.6,"channel":{"name":"ABC","id":3,"url":"https://abc.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/423/1058922.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/423/1058922.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>9-1-1</b> is a fast-paced exploration into the lives and careers of first responders – cops, paramedics, firefighters – the people who put their lives on the line to save others.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2689396,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2689396/station-19-7x01-episode-1","name":"Episode 1","season":7,"number":1,"airdate":"2024-03-14","airstamp":"2024-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":34577,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/34577/station-19","name":"Station 19","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Action","Romance"],"premiered":"2018-03-22","rating":6.8,"channel":{"name":"ABC","id":3,"url":"https://abc.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/424/1061060.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/424/1061060.jpg"},"summary":"<p>In Seattle, all firefighters are also trained EMTs and the crew at Station 19 is second to none.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there's Sheldon's beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric, and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy allows us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward, and hopeful journey toward the man he will become.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2699570,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2699570/next-level-chef-3x09-tba","name":"TBA","season":3,"number":9,"airdate":"2024-03-21","airstamp":"2024-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":55426,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/55426/next-level-chef","name":"Next Level Chef","language":"English","genres":["Food"],"premiered":"2022-01-02","rating":6.6,"channel":{"name":"FOX","id":4,"url":"https://www.fox.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/437/1094161.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/437/1094161.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Chef Gordon Ramsay scours the country for the very best line cooks, home chefs, social media stars, food truck owners and everything in between, all competing against one another with the goal of finding the food world's newest superstar.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there's Sheldon's beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts.

Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there's Sheldon's beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric, and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy allows us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward, and hopeful journey toward the man he will become.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2711848,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2711848/station-19-7x04-episode-4","name":"Episode 4","season":7,"number":4,"airdate":"2024-04-04","airstamp":"2024-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":34577,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/34577/station-19","name":"Station 19","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Action","Romance"],"premiered":"2018-03-22","rating":6.8,"channel":{"name":"ABC","id":3,"url":"https://abc.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/424/1061060.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/424/1061060.jpg"},"summary":"<p>In Seattle, all firefighters are also trained EMTs and the crew at Station 19 is second to none.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there's Sheldon's beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric, and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy allows us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward, and hopeful journey toward the man he will become.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2711849,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2711849/station-19-7x05-episode-5","name":"Episode 5","season":7,"number":5,"airdate":"2024-04-11","airstamp":"2024-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":34577,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/34577/station-19","name":"Station 19","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Action","Romance"],"premiered":"2018-03-22","rating":6.8,"channel":{"name":"ABC","id":3,"url":"https://abc.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/424/1061060.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/424/1061060.jpg"},"summary":"<p>In Seattle, all firefighters are also trained EMTs and the crew at Station 19 is second to none.

It is always held on Patriots' Day, the third Monday of April. Begun in 1897, inspired by the success of the first modern-day marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics, the Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors, and is one of four major events held in the United States through the years of both World Wars (Kentucky Derby, Rose Parade, and Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show are the others). Since 1897, the Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has managed this event. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there's Sheldon's beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric, and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy allows us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward, and hopeful journey toward the man he will become.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2711850,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2711850/station-19-7x06-episode-6","name":"Episode 6","season":7,"number":6,"airdate":"2024-04-18","airstamp":"2024-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":34577,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/34577/station-19","name":"Station 19","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Action","Romance"],"premiered":"2018-03-22","rating":6.8,"channel":{"name":"ABC","id":3,"url":"https://abc.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/424/1061060.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/424/1061060.jpg"},"summary":"<p>In Seattle, all firefighters are also trained EMTs and the crew at Station 19 is second to none.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there's Sheldon's beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric, and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper. This single-camera, half-hour comedy allows us the chance to meet him in childhood, as he embarks on his innocent, awkward, and hopeful journey toward the man he will become.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2711851,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2711851/station-19-7x07-episode-7","name":"Episode 7","season":7,"number":7,"airdate":"2024-04-25","airstamp":"2024-04-26T00:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":34577,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/34577/station-19","name":"Station 19","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Action","Romance"],"premiered":"2018-03-22","rating":6.8,"channel":{"name":"ABC","id":3,"url":"https://abc.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/424/1061060.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/424/1061060.jpg"},"summary":"<p>In Seattle, all firefighters are also trained EMTs and the crew at Station 19 is second to none.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there's Sheldon's beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric, and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper.

Being a once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science isn't always helpful in a land where church and football are king. And while the vulnerable, gifted and somewhat naïve Sheldon deals with the world, his very normal family must find a way to deal with him. His father, George, is struggling to find his way as a high school football coach and as father to a boy he doesn't understand. Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures her son in a town where he just doesn't fit in. Sheldon's older brother, Georgie, does the best he can in high school, but it's tough to be cool when you're in the same classes with your odd younger brother. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, sometimes resents all the attention Sheldon gets, but also remains the one person who can reliably tell Sheldon the truth. Finally, there's Sheldon's beloved Meemaw, his foul-mouthed, hard-drinking Texas grandmother who is very supportive of her grandson and his unique gifts. For 12 years on <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, audiences have come to know the iconic, eccentric, and extraordinary Sheldon Cooper.

The event is traditionally held over Memorial Day weekend, usually the last weekend of May. It is contested as part of the IndyCar Series, the top level of American open-wheel car racing, a formula colloquially known as \"Indy car racing\". The track itself is nicknamed the \"Brickyard\", as the racing surface was paved in brick in the fall of 1909. One yard of brick remains exposed at the start/finish line. The event, billed as <i>The Greatest Spectacle in Racing</i>, is considered part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport along with the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Monaco Grand Prix, with which it typically shares a date. The inaugural race was held in 1911 and was won by Ray Harroun. The event celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011, and the 100th running was held in 2016. The event was put on hiatus twice, from 1917 to 1918 due to World War I and from 1942 to 1945 due to World War II. In two different periods, the race was part of FIA World Championships: between 1925 and 1928, the World Manufacturers' Championship and between 1950 and 1960, the World Drivers' Championship.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2559748,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2559748/national-memorial-day-concert-2024-05-26-35th-annual-national-memorial-day-concert","name":"35th Annual National Memorial Day Concert","season":2024,"number":1,"airdate":"2024-05-26","airstamp":"2024-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":12222,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/12222/national-memorial-day-concert","name":"National Memorial Day Concert","language":"English","genres":["Music","History"],"premiered":"1990-05-27","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"PBS","id":85,"url":"https://www.pbs.org/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/409/1023083.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/409/1023083.jpg"},"summary":"<p>The <b>National Memorial Day Concert</b> features uplifting musical performances, documentary footage, and dramatic readings that honor the military service of all our men and women in uniform and their families at home.

Colts and geldings carry a weight of 126 pounds (57 kg); fillies carry 121 pounds (55 kg). The race, nicknamed The Test of the Champion, The Test of Champions and The Run for the Carnations, is the traditional third and final leg of the Triple Crown. It is usually held on the first or second Saturday in June, five weeks after the Kentucky Derby and three weeks after the Preakness Stakes. The 1973 Belmont Stakes and Triple Crown winner Secretariat holds the mile and a half stakes record (which is also a track and world record on dirt) of 2:24.</p><p>When run at 1+1⁄2 miles, the Belmont Stakes covers one full lap of Belmont Park, known as \"The Championship Track\" because nearly every major American champion in racing history has competed on the racetrack. Belmont Park, with its large, wide, sweeping turns and long homestretch, is considered one of the fairest racetracks in America. Despite the distance, the race tends to favor horses with tactical speed: relatively few winners close from far behind the early leaders.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2718690,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2718690/monster-jam-21x19-arlington","name":"Arlington","season":21,"number":19,"airdate":"2024-06-08","airstamp":"2024-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":14586,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/14586/monster-jam","name":"Monster Jam","language":"English","genres":[],"premiered":"2004-01-01","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"MAVTV","id":739,"url":"https://www.mavtv.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/447/1118551.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/447/1118551.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>Monster Jam</b> is the world's largest and most famous monster truck tour where world-class drivers compete in front of capacity crowds in racing and freestyle competitions.

GameDay</b> is an ESPN entertainment show previewing college football games. It first aired in 1987 with Tim Brando as host and Lee Corso and Beano Cook as commentators, giving an overview of college football games, but the show underwent a radical transformation beginning in 1993, and began incorporating live broadcasts. The official name of the show is <i>College GameDay built by The Home Depot</i>. There is a separate radio broadcast, <i>ESPN Radio College GameDay</i>, on ESPN Radio. Today, the only original cast member remaining is Lee Corso. Rece Davis serves as host and Kirk Herbstreit is Corso's counterpart. Starting in 2008, Desmond Howardhas been added to the cast in the show's introduction. Craig James served as an analyst from 1990 to 1995. Erin Andrews joined the <i>GameDay</i> crew as a co-host and contributor in 2010, replaced in 2012 by Samantha Ponder. On September 5, 2015, Rece Davis (also host of the college basketball version of <i>GameDay</i>), replaced Chris Fowler as host of the college football version, which itself started its 29th season on that day.</p><p>The show is known for its prediction segment that appears on each broadcast. Typically there are three predictors: Corso, Herbstreit, and an invited guest, usually a celebrity, prominent athlete, or radio personality associated with the host university or school for that week. The end of the show always concludes with a catch phrase and prediction from Corso, who subsequently dons the mascot's headgear of the school he predicts to win the game, usually to the ire or excitement of local fans. Beginning with the 2013 season, <i>GameDay</i> airs for three hours on ESPN. Previously, beginning in 2010, the first hour of the show was broadcast on ESPNU at 9am ET, with the 2 remaining hours of the show on ESPN from 10am-noon ET.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2642916,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2642916/aer-lingus-college-football-classic-ireland-2024-08-24-georgia-tech-yellow-jackets-vs-florida-state-seminoles","name":"Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets vs. Florida State Seminoles","season":2024,"number":1,"airdate":"2024-08-24","airstamp":"2024-08-24T23:30:00+00:00","show":{"id":70390,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/70390/aer-lingus-college-football-classic-ireland","name":"Aer Lingus College Football Classic Ireland","language":"English","genres":[],"premiered":"2023-08-26","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"NBC","id":1,"url":"https://www.nbc.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/472/1180863.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/472/1180863.jpg"},"summary":"<p><b>Aer Lingus College Football Classic Ireland </b>began initially in 1988 as part of a promotional campaign to mark the Dublin millennium celebrations. Dubbed the Emerald Isle Classic, it was the first NCAA-sanctioned American college football game played in Europe. The game was played at Lansdowne Road in Dublin, Ireland in the years 1988 and 1989. The event was first proposed and arranged by Aidan J. Prendergast and Jim O'Brien. Prendergast, who was a former president of the Irish American Football Association conceived the idea of bringing a major NCAA game to Ireland in the mid-1980s and started pitching the idea on both sides of the Atlantic. Prendergast promoted both the 1988 and 1989 games. </p><p>The game was intended as an annual event to attract some of the 40 million Americans of Irish descent back to Ireland. College teams with particularly Irish or Catholic background were chosen in an effort to attract Irish nationals to the games.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2718777,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2718777/monster-jam-arena-in-30-2x15-lincoln","name":"Lincoln","season":2,"number":15,"airdate":"2024-08-25","airstamp":"2024-08-25T12:30:00+00:00","show":{"id":67083,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/67083/monster-jam-arena-in-30","name":"Monster Jam Arena in 30","language":"English","genres":[],"premiered":"2023-02-19","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"MAVTV","id":739,"url":"https://www.mavtv.com/"},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/452/1130128.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/452/1130128.jpg"},"summary":null,"country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2723147,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2723147/raw-talk-8x35-raw-talk-230","name":"Raw Talk 230","season":8,"number":35,"airdate":"2024-08-26","airstamp":"2024-08-26T16:00:00+00:00","show":{"id":22473,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/22473/raw-talk","name":"RAW Talk","language":"English","genres":["Sports"],"premiered":"2016-10-30","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"WWE Network","id":15,"url":null},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/409/1024249.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/409/1024249.jpg"},"summary":"<p>On <b>RAW Talk</b>, Renee Young catches up with your favorite WWE RAW Superstars after each episode of \"RAW\" airs on the USA Network to hear their thoughts on all of that evening's action.</p>","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US"}}},{"id":2642939,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/episodes/2642939/aflac-kickoff-game-2024-08-31-clemson-tigers-vs-georgia-bulldogs","name":"Clemson Tigers vs. Georgia Bulldogs","season":2024,"number":1,"airdate":"2024-08-31","airstamp":"2024-08-31T23:30:00+00:00","show":{"id":70389,"url":"https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/70389/aflac-kickoff-game","name":"Aflac Kickoff Game","language":"English","genres":[],"premiered":"2023-09-01","rating":null,"channel":{"name":"ESPN","id":39},"image":{"medium":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/472/1180862.jpg","original":"https://static.tvmaze.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/472/1180862.jpg"},"summary":"<p>The <b>Aflac Kickoff Game</b> is an annual series of college football games played on the opening weekend of the NCAA Division I FBS season in Atlanta, Georgia.

<b>New York City Marathon,</b> currently branded as the TCS New York City Marathon for sponsorship reasons, is an annual marathon (42.195 km or 26.219 mi) that courses through the five boroughs of New York City. It is the largest marathon in the world, with 53,627 finishers in 2019 and 98,247 applicants for the 2017 race. Along with the Boston Marathon and Chicago Marathon, it is among the pre-eminent long-distance annual running events in the United States and is one of the World Marathon Majors.</p><p>The race is organized by New York Road Runners and has been run every year since 1970, with the exception of 2012, when it was cancelled due to the landfall of Hurricane Sandy, and 2020, when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race is held on the first Sunday of November and attracts professional competitors and amateurs from all over the world. Because of the popularity of the race, participation is chosen largely by a lottery system. Guaranteed entry to the marathon can be gained by satisfying the requirements of the 9+1 program or the 9+$1K program (where NYRR members run in nine sponsored races and either volunteer at another event or donate $1,000 to support NYRR programs for young athletes), having completed 15 or more previous NYC Marathons, or meeting time qualification standards.
